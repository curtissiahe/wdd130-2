  <p>Hi everyone, let me introduce myself. I am 24 years old and i am from the ivory coast. I still single and i live
    with my parents that is my mother and my two other brothers.</p>
  <p> first taught english as a second language for two years here in the ivory coast and i had to quit the job because
    i got a better job now. I currently work as a bilingual care representative and almost 80% of the job is computer
    based.</p>
  <p>And pursuing this degree would help me improve in my company especially to work in IT branch of the company. One of
    thing i love about BYU-Idaho is that courses are as the same as the students on campus that i why i chose BS in
    software development.</p>
  <p> degree is special gift from god as i did not have opportunity to continue my education after high school
    graduation it is a means to make my dream a reality... </p>
